There is a utility in the Tools folder that reads the data model definition in Model.xlsx and then generates some additional artifacts:
JSON file
DDL script
Images

These artifacts should always be maintained in source control and should always match the model that's defined in the Model.xlsx file. 

Today, a developer is responsible for updating the model in Model.xlsx, then manually generating these artifacts and including them on a PR when they are committing to source control.

The issue is that people don't always remember to do this.

So, I want these artifacts to be created automatically when a Pull Request is created and added to the pull request. Then the developer only ever has to modify Model.xlsx.

The workflow is therefore this for a developer:
1. They update Model.xlsx with changes to the data model
2. They create a Pull Request with the new Model.xlsx and with a suitable comment explaining their changes
3. A github Action detects that there is a change to Model.xlsx and runs the utility to generate the artifacts above
4. The action then adds these generated items to the PR
5. When the PR is approved and merged, these artifacts get included in the merged
